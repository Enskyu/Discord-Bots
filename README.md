# Discord Bots

## Purpose
This project aims to compile all Discord bots I've ever made for whatever purpose. The project is made in Python.

## Standards
This project uses common standards for Python, such as but not limited to:
 - Follows snake_case naming convention for variables
 - Follows indentation and spacing conventions

## Usage
To run this file, clone this [repository](https://github.com/Enskyu/Discord-Bots.git)
<br/> Open this file using your IDE
<br/> Add a line to the code to run with your bot token
<br/> Run the specific file to start the specific bot

## How to play
Once the bot is running, use Discord to run the commands. Key functionalities include:

Chicken Bot:
- $count: returns the amount of chickens currently saved
- $add: adds 2 chickens to the amount currently saved
<br/> Warning: The chicken_count must be updated manually before bot shuts down or else it will start counting from last saved value

Duplicates Checker:
- ~show: returns all messages stored by bot since start
- ~clear: clears all currenly saved messages
<br/> Note: If a message duplicates, it will show in the terminal of the IDE
